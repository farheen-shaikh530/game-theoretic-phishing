# game-theoretic-phishing
This study models phishing as a repeated two-player zero-sum game with Q-learning attackers and adaptive defenders using NLP and sandboxing. Visualized through heatmaps, results show adaptive strategies reduce phishing success. Future work explores Bayesian updates and multi-attacker scenarios.
